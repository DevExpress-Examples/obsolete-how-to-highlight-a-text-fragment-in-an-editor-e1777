# (Obsolete) How to highlight a text fragment in an editor


<p>This example demonstrates how to use the internal mechanism intended to support the Incremental Search functionality, to highlight a portion of text in the editor, when the TextEditStyle property is set to TextEditStyles.DisableTextEditor, and its MaskBox is unavailable. This approach will work properly with all ButtonEdit descendants, except for editors derived from the PopupBaseAutoSearchEdit.</p>
